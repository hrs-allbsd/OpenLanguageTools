Full information on how to build and install the Open Language Tools components
is available at https://open-language-tools.dev.java.net.

If you don't have access to that, then get a copy of ant (1.6.2 or later)
and the Java 1.4.2 SDK. Then issue the command :

ant transeditor
or
ant filters

which will then start the build process. Built components will be dropped in a
newly created build/ directory.
