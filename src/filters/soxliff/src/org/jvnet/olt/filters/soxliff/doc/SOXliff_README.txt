Basic description
----------------

The filter is writen for StarOffice database xliff file. It converts
StarOffice xliff files to OLT xliff file. Also we have special
backconverter for it.

Reason
------

The xliff file generated by StarOffice database does not contains segmented
text. Another problem is that they have escaped tags in the xliff file like:

\<bookmark\>

OLT is not able to handle this.

How it works
------------

1) it parses SOXliff with dom4j parser

2) the filter use dom4j visitor patern to walk through staroffice xliff

3) javacc parser RemoveEscapeChars converts all escaped tags to normal tags
like:

\<bookmark\> is converted to <bookmark>

4) text is segmented with OLT segmenter. Original xliff ids are stored
   in xliff context parameter: 'x-original-id' and mid segment whitespaces
   are stored in context parameter: 'x-subformat-ws'

5) The filter does not support cross tags segmentation. If the segmented text
   is not possible to parse with xml parser the filter leave the original text
   unsegmented

6) XliffSegmenterFormatter generated the OLT xliff and OLT format wrappers
   are used for adding tag protection
