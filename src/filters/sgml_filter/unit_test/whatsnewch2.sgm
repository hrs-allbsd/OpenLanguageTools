This boot partition, which requires 10 Mbytes of disk space, can be installed on a disk separate from the rest of the Solaris operating environment, thus enabling the user to install more than one operating system on a machine. Only the boot partition needs to be located on the boot disk.</para>
<para>For more information, see the <olink targetdocent="SPARCINSTALL" type="V-ONLY"><citetitle>Solaris Advanced Installation Guide</citetitle></olink>. </para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="whatsnewch2-77" arch="ia"><title>CD-ROM Boot</title>
<para>This new feature enables the user to boot a system from an installation CD (rather than the Device Configuration Assistant diskette, as was the case in the past) using the &ldquo;El Torito&rdquo; standard.     </para>
<para>The BIOS on most &ia; based motherboards manufactured since late 1997 supports the &ldquo;El Torito&rdquo; standard and thus recognizes CD-ROM drives as boot devices. To turn on this capability, the user runs the system's BIOS setup tool.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="whatsnewch2-71"><title>DHCP Manager</title>
<para>DHCP Manager provides a Java-based graphical interface for configuring and managing the Solaris DHCP server  and DHCP databases. It enables the system administrator to use a single tool to perform all DHCP management duties: set up and manage DHCP servers, manage client configuration options and macros, and manage networks and IP addresses that are under DHCP management.  </para>
<para>DHCP Manager can be used instead of the Solaris DHCP command-line utilities, or in combination with them. </para>
<para> DHCP Manager provides the following benefits:<itemizedlist>

<para>NFS server logging allows an NFS server to provide a record of  file operations performed on its file systems. The record includes information to keep track of what is accessed,  when it is accessed, and who accessed it. The location of the logs that contain this information can be specified through a set of configuration options. These options also can be used to select the operations that should be logged. This feature is particularly useful for sites that make anonymous FTP archives available to NFS and WebNFS clients.</para>

<sect3 id="whatsnewch2-146"><title>The <command>coreadm</command> command</title>
<para>This release introduces the <command>coreadm</command> command, which provides flexible core file naming conventions and better core file retention. For example, you can use the <command>coreadm</command> command to configure a system so that all process core files are placed in a single system directory. This means it is easier to track problems by examining the core files in a specific directory whenever a Solaris process or daemon terminates abnormally.</para>
<para>Two new configurable <filename>core</filename> file paths, per-process and global, can be enabled or disabled independent of each other. When a process terminates abnormally, it produces a <filename>core</filename> file in the current directory as in previous Solaris releases. But if a global core file path is enabled and set to <filename>/corefiles/core</filename>, for example, then each process that terminates abnormally produces <replaceable>two</replaceable> core files: one in the current working directory and one in the <filename>/corefiles</filename> directory.</para>
<para>By default, the Solaris core paths and core file retention remain the same.</para>

<para>Some of the proc tools have been enhanced to examine process core files as well as live processes. The proc tools are utilities that can manipulate features of the <filename>/proc</filename> file system.</para>
<para>The <command>/usr/proc/bin/pstack</command>, <command>pmap</command>, <command>pldd</command>, <command>pflags</command>, and <command>pcred</command> tools can now be applied to core files by specifying the name of the core file on the command line, similar to the way you specify a process ID to these commands. For example:</para>

<para>In previous Solaris releases, device configuration was handled by <command>drvconfig</command>, which managed the physical device entries in the <filename>/devices</filename> directory, and five link generators, <command>devlinks</command>, <command>disks</command>, <command>tapes</command>, <command>ports</command>, and <command>audlinks</command>, which managed the logical device entries in the <filename>/dev</filename> directory.  For compatibility purposes, <command>drvconfig</command> and the other link generators are symbolic links to the <command>devfsadm</command> utility.</para>
<para>Both reconfiguration boot processing and updating the <filename>/dev</filename> and <filename>/devices</filename> directories in response to dynamic reconfiguration events are handled by <command>devfsadmd</command>, the daemon version of the <command>devfsadm</command> command.

</highlights>
<sect2 id="whatsnewch2-86" arch="ia"><title>Added Support for PAE Mode</title>
<para>With the release of Pentium Pro, Intel introduced a mode called Physical Address Extension (PAE) on its advanced processors. By using PAE, Solaris <emphasis>Intel Platform Edition</emphasis> can address up to 32 Gbytes of physical memory. Individual processes are still limited to a maximum of 3.5 Gbytes of virtual address space.</para>
<para>PAE mode enables the user to run multiple instances of databases and memory-intensive applications, and to support large numbers of online users on a machine.</para>
<para>It is best to use PCI disk controllers that support Dual Address Cycle (DAC) in your machine because they can transfer data to and    from any physical location. Other cards are limited to 4 Gbytes of     physical memory, and as a result performance may slow down because    the system needs to copy additional memory to transfer data.</para>
<caution>
<para>Some device drivers are not yet able to take advantage of PAE mode. Sun has tested PCI device drivers written by Sun on &ia; based machines with more than 4 Gbytes of memory. Sun's OEM partners intend to test their machines with devices they supply on &ia; based machines with more than 4 Gbytes of memory. In some cases however, if you add a third-party device driver to your system, it may become unstable, and panics and data corruption may result. If your system becomes unstable and you need that driver, you must disable PAE mode support.

<para>A new system monitoring tool, <command>busstat</command> provides command line access to the  bus-related hardware performance counters in the system. It enables the gathering of system-wide bus performance statistics directly from the system hardware. The current list of supported hardware is SBus, AC and PCI devices. These are all SPARC system devices. Currently, there are no &ia; supported devices.</para>

<sect2 id="whatsnewch2-152"><title>Role-Based Access Control</title>
<para>Traditional superuser-based systems grant full superuser powers to anyone who can become superuser. With role-based access control (RBAC) in the &Product; operating environment, administrators can assign limited  administrative capabilities to normal users.  This is achieved through three  new features:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Authorizations &mdash; user rights that grant access to a restricted function</para>

</listitem><listitem><para>Roles &mdash; special types of user accounts intended for performing a set of administrative tasks</para>
</listitem></itemizedlist>
<para>The administrator creates an execution profile containing authorizations and privileged commands for a specific task or set of tasks.  That profile can be assigned directly to a user or to a role.  Roles, in turn, are assigned to users.  To gain access to a role, a user with the assigned role executes the <command>su</command> command.  Roles have the advantage of being shared accounts that do not need to be updated when individual responsibilities change. The following new files support RBAC: </para>

<para>This section describes new features in the &Product; operating environment that affect printer configuration and management.</para>
<sect2 id="chapter1-15"><title>Print Naming Enhancement</title>
<para>This Solaris release supports the <literal>printers</literal> database in <filename>/etc/nsswitch.conf</filename>, the name service switch file. The <literal>printers</literal> database provides centralized printer configuration information to print clients on the network.  </para>
<para>By including the <literal>printers</literal> database and corresponding sources of information in the name service switch file, print clients automatically have access to printer configuration information without having to add it to their own systems.</para>
<para>If you use Solaris Print Manager to set up printing in your network, the source of the printer configuration information is selected from the Select Naming Service menu rather than the <literal>printers</literal> database in the <filename>/etc/nsswitch.conf</filename> file.</para>
<para>The following table describes the default <literal>printers</literal> entry in the <literal>/etc/nsswitch.conf</literal> file for the files, NIS, and NIS+ environments. The <literal>nisplus</literal> keyword represents the <filename>printers.org_dir</filename> table. The <literal>xfn</literal> keyword represents the FNS printer contexts.</para>
<informaltable frame="topbot"><tgroup cols="2" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><colspec colwidth="36.16*"><colspec colwidth="63.84*"><thead><row rowsep="1"><entry><para>If Your Name Service Is ...</para></entry><entry><para>The Default <literal>printers</literal> Entry Is ...</para></entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry><para><literal>files</literal></para></entry><entry><para><literal>printers:	user files</literal></para></entry></row><row><entry><para><literal>nis</literal></para></entry><entry><para><literal>printers:	user files nis</literal></para></entry></row><row><entry><para><literal>nis+</literal></para></entry><entry><para><literal>printers:	user nisplus files xfn</literal></para></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></informaltable>

This tool can be used in the following name service environments: NIS, NIS+, NIS+ with Federated Naming Service (FNS), and files. You must be logged in as superuser to use this tool. </para>
<para>Using Solaris Print Manager is the preferred method for managing printer access instead of Admintool:Printers because Solaris Print Manager centralizes printer information when it is used in a name service environment.</para>
<para>Solaris Print Manager recognizes existing printer information on the printer servers, print clients, and in the name service databases. There are no conversion tasks required to use the new Solaris Print Manager as long as the print clients are running the Solaris 2.6 release or a compatible version.</para>

</highlights>
<sect2 id="whatsnewch2-79"><title>Universal Language Coverage</title>
<para>The &Product; operating environment now includes support for more than 90 locales, covering 37 languages, on both the  &Product; Software CDs and the &Product; Languages CD.</para>
<para>The &Product; Software CDs provide an English interface to input, display, and print text in a target language, including multibyte locales. In addition, the  &Product; Languages CD provides localized interface and documentation.</para>
<para>This new packaging approach greatly simplifies the development  and testing of  applications for international markets and eliminates the need to purchase  an optional media kit to set  up a non-English development or production  environment.</para>
<para>Customers will also notice a new locale installation mechanism. In previous Solaris releases the locale support included with the operating environment depended on the software cluster installed. The new installation interface in the &Product; operating environment  enables users to install only those regions for which they require locale  support. </para>

<para>Users will find the setup and installation to  be significantly easier, whether installing only a single language or the full range of 37  languages packaged with the &Product; operating environment. </para>
<para>Changes to packaging on the &Product; CD have reduced the storage requirements for a  mixed language installation and a redesign of the install interface makes  language selection and grouping extremely intuitive.</para>

<para>Also, complete support for Complex Text Layout (CTL) scripts has been enabled. This allows proper rendering of text for bidirectional and also context-sensitive shaping scripts like Arabic, Hebrew, and Thai in the Unicode locale.</para>
<para>Unicode is often used in a mixed script environment, where it is necessary to display text from multiple languages in a single environment. In those cases  where it is necessary to provide support for cultural-specific  conventions such as date and time, monetary format, and collation,  the multiple Unicode locales provided in Solaris are quite useful.</para>

<para>The standard Solaris threads implementation is a two-level model, in which user-level threads are multiplexed over possibly fewer lightweight processes, (LWPs).  An LWP is the fundamental unit of execution that is dispatched to a processor by the operating system.  </para>
<para>Solaris 8 software provides an alternate threads implementation, a one-level model, in which user-level threads are associated one-to-one with LWPs.  This implementation is simpler than the standard implementation and may be beneficial to some multithreaded applications.  It provides the same interfaces for POSIX threads and Solaris threads as for the standard implementation.  </para>
<para>Existing multihreaded programs can be bound with the alternate libthread at run time using the <envar>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</envar> and <envar>LD_LIBRARY_PATH_64</envar>environment variable. </para>

<para>The 8&ndash;bit visual shared library provides a set of translation functions, enabling 8-bit visual applications to run on hardware that only provides support for 24-bit visual depth. The functions use the device driver's native 24-bit rendering function calls for applications requesting 8-bit visual support. This is done by translating 8-bit pseudocolor colormap pixel data into 24-bit truecolor colormap pixel data before rendering an image on the 24-bit hardware visual supported platform.</para>

<title>Sun WBEM SDK</title>
<para>Sun WBEM Software Developer's Kit (SDK) is a developer's toolkit you can use to create applications and providers for WBEM-enabled environments. Using the client  application programming interfaces (APIs), you can develop  applications to run in and manage any WBEM-enabled environment. Additionally,
you can use the provider APIs to develop provider programs that enable  specific technologies, such as a device that uses a specific protocol, to  communicate with a WBEM-enabled environment. </para>
<para>Sun WBEM SDK includes the following components:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Client API, a public set of APIs that enable applications to communicate with the CIM Object Manager using Remote Method Invocation (RMI) or eXtensible Markup Language (XML) over HTTP</para>
