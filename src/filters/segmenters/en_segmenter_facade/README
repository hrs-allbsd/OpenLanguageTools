This directory is a placeholder for an english-only
version of the filters. On my mac at home, I have
problems building all the lang-specific segmenters
This is due to an Apple Java VM bug I think, so 
I have a special segmenter_facade
there that only uses the en_segmenter. I haven't
added that stuff to the workspace, since we
wouldn't want to use only the en segmenter in
production (we would rather use the de,es,fr,it
and sv specific segmentation behaviour if possible
-- note that of course, these are only used
when doing alignment : nearly all of the time when
we're segmenting, it's to convert files to xliff
before tm lookup)
