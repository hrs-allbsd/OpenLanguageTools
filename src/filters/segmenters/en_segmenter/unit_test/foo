So there. >also</a> support u-Law (u is for the Greek letter mu, which can't be reproduces in simple text like this, but it can in postscript), and A-Law. When combined together with precision we support 16-bit Linear PCM, 8-bit Linear PCM, 8-bit u-Law, and 8-bit A-Law. Also, linear PCM may be signed or unsigned, we support only signed. Sample Rate The number of times a second the audio stream is sampled and thus converted from an analog signal to a digital number for recording. Or converted from a digital number to an analog signal when playing. The higher the number the greater the accuracy of the digital signal. But a higher number also means more disk space is needed for storage or network bandwith is needed to transfer the data. Channels The number of samples in a sample frame. Currently we support 1 (mono) or 2 (stereo).
