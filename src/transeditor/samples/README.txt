This directory contains sample .xlz files for some of the supported 
formats.

All files except those listed below do not contain translation, nor their
target language is set, so you can open them in any project.

Instructions on how to set the editor to test the samples:
- for files which do *not* have target language set create a project
  with source language en-US, target language of your desire;
  Open the file and confirm to set the target language to the same
  as the project target language. And that's it !

- for files which *do* have a target language set, create a project
  with source language en-US and target language as listed below.
  Open the file and start translating. 
  If you try to open file with combination of languages en-US,fr-FR
  in project en-US, es-ES the editor will not open the file


Files listed below *have* target language set, so you need to create
a project with the same language pair
