    </trans-unit>
<trans-unit id="a27">    
      <source>In addition to this, I've also written an application that was on the list of proposals for Solaris 8 - called <bpt id="1">&lt;a href="http://www.ireland/%7Etimf/compose"&gt;</bpt>ComposeTool<ept id="1">&lt;/a&gt;</ept>, which shows users how to enter characters that don't appear on the users keyboard.</source>
    </trans-unit>
<trans-unit id="a28">    
      <source>I've a <bpt id="1">&lt;a href="composetool.gif"&gt;</bpt>snapshot <ept id="1">&lt;/a&gt;</ept>of it here - <bpt id="2">&lt;a href="mailto:tim.foster@ireland"&gt;</bpt>mail me <ept id="2">&lt;/a&gt;</ept>if you've any comments about it.</source>
    </trans-unit>
<trans-unit id="a29">    
      <source>(it was a little like the Micro$oft <bpt id="1">&lt;tt&gt;</bpt>charmap <ept id="1">&lt;/tt&gt;</ept>program) It never made it into Solaris, but it was an educational experience..</source>
    </trans-unit>
<trans-unit id="a30">    
      <source>I haven't touched it for a while, but I'm continually whining about the European/simple input-mode usability on Solaris.</source>
    </trans-unit>
<trans-unit id="a31">    
      <source>Maybe someday people will listen, and start working on this.</source>
    </trans-unit>
<trans-unit id="a32">    
      <source>To this end, I converted the Openwindows <bpt id="1">&lt;a href="http://www.ireland/%7Etimf/compose.xml"&gt;</bpt>compose-file to an XML format<ept id="1">&lt;/a&gt;</ept> :</source>
    </trans-unit>
<trans-unit id="a33">    
      <source>this was part of a <bpt id="1">&lt;a href="http://www.ireland/%7Etimf/compose-proposal.txt"&gt;</bpt>proposal<ept id="1">&lt;/a&gt;</ept> some of us were putting together to allow for user-defined keyboards - this would ease the transition to USB keyboards, taking some of the load off the localisation teams to support every keyboard type available.</source>
    </trans-unit>
<trans-unit id="a34">    
      <source>However, this idea has never really made it any further.</source>
    </trans-unit>
<trans-unit id="a35">    
      <source>Let me know if you're interested in championing this cause...</source>
    </trans-unit>
<trans-unit id="a36">    
      <source>( it never really got anywhere )</source>
    </trans-unit>
<trans-unit id="a37">    
      <source>Translation Technology:</source>
    </trans-unit>
<trans-unit id="a38">    
      <source>At the moment I deal with <bpt id="1">&lt;a href="http://software.eng/cats/gss/tlis/presentations/img4.html"&gt;</bpt>translation memory technology<ept id="1">&lt;/a&gt;</ept>.</source>
    </trans-unit>
<trans-unit id="a39">    
      <source>The TMC Infrastructure/SunTrans project didn't work out that well (the external partner we were dealing with had severe engineering-process problems), and we have been left with a tool that works, but has many limitations.</source>
    </trans-unit>
<trans-unit id="a40">    
      <source>I'm writing translation memory tools, along with <bpt id="1">&lt;a href="http://sunweb.ireland/%7Ejc73554"&gt;</bpt>John Corrigan<ept id="1">&lt;/a&gt;</ept>, that aim to fix most of the short-comings in SunTrans.</source>
    </trans-unit>
<trans-unit id="a41">    
      <source>We have already written a comprehensive set of parsers, based around <bpt id="1">&lt;a href="http://www.webgain.com/products/java_cc/"&gt;</bpt>JavaCC<ept id="1">&lt;/a&gt;</ept> which we use in the current software leveraging functionality of SunTrans.</source>
    </trans-unit>
<trans-unit id="a42">    
      <source>These are more detailed than simply calling the i18n message processing framework, per file-format, instead they parse the source message format itself - which is much more useful.</source>
    </trans-unit>
<trans-unit id="a43">    
      <source>Already, these parsers have found numerous bugs in Sun localisation files (eg. incorrectly formatted messages that the message compilers missed, duplicate messages, etc.)</source>
    </trans-unit>
<trans-unit id="a44">    
      <source>I also wrote an <bpt id="1">&lt;em&gt;</bpt>SGML-sensitive sentence segmenter<ept id="1">&lt;/em&gt;</ept> - one of the 1st things you need to be able to do in order to reuse translations from a previous product (cut a document up into sentences).</source>
    </trans-unit>
<trans-unit id="a45">    
      <source>I have a <bpt id="1">&lt;a href="./Sgml-segmenter.html"&gt;</bpt>paper about this here<ept id="1">&lt;/a&gt;</ept>.</source>
    </trans-unit>
<trans-unit id="a46">    
      <source>I'm not actively maintaining this, but we're planning on using a similar technique in the next version of SunTrans.</source>
    </trans-unit>
<trans-unit id="a47">    
      <source>At the moment, I'm concentrating on trying to spec out the new version of SunTrans, and it's proving quite exciting.</source>
    </trans-unit>
<trans-unit id="a48">    
      <source>We're basing the whole thing on the SunONE software stack - and I already have a fair bit of code running on the Java 2 Enterprise Edition Reference Implementation 1.3 server.</source>
    </trans-unit>
<trans-unit id="a49">    
      <source>I'm currently working on getting this ported to SunONE Application Server 7 as well as writing other pars of the system, such as a HTML file filter and writing sentence segmenters.</source>
    </trans-unit>
<trans-unit id="a50">    
      <source>Sidelines:</source>
    </trans-unit>
<trans-unit id="a51">    
      <source>As a sideline to all this translation technology work, I like to keep up to date with desktop technology.</source>
    </trans-unit>
<trans-unit id="a52">    
      <source>I've been running the GNOME desktop for a long time (before Sun picked it up) and was maintaining my own Solaris builds of it for a while.</source>
    </trans-unit>
<trans-unit id="a53">    
      <source>These days, I don't have the time to do this, but I do every once in a while grab tarballs and play around with whatever's new.</source>
    </trans-unit>
<trans-unit id="a54">    
      <source>Interestingly enough, I have two brothers who also work at Sun - both working in the <bpt id="1">&lt;a href="http://www-dt.ireland/"&gt;</bpt>Webtop &amp;amp; Applications Software Group<ept id="1">&lt;/a&gt;</ept> Duncan, who's working on StarOffice stuff I think and <bpt id="2">&lt;a href="http://www.gnome.org/%7Egman/photojournal"&gt;</bpt>Glynn<ept id="2">&lt;/a&gt;</ept>, who was one of Sun's candidates for the recent GNOME Foundation Elections and hacks on GNOME.</source>
    </trans-unit>
<trans-unit id="a55">    
      <source>I wrote an application that changes colours for gtk2 applications.</source>
    </trans-unit>
<trans-unit id="a56">

    </trans-unit>
<trans-unit id="a59">    
      <source>I used to be in <bpt id="1">&lt;a href="http://www.ucd.ie"&gt;</bpt>U.C.D.<ept id="1">&lt;/a&gt;</ept> and hold a BSc.</source>

      <source>It's not terribly well sorted, and all lower case.</source>
