        <p>In addition to this, I've also written an application that was 
    on           the list of proposals for Solaris 8 - called <a
 href="http://www.ireland/%7Etimf/compose">ComposeTool</a>, which shows  
        users how to enter characters that don't appear on the users    
      keyboard. I've a <a href="composetool.gif">snapshot </a>of it here -
          <a href="mailto:tim.foster@ireland">mail me </a>if you've any 
          comments about it. (it was a little like the Micro$oft <tt>charmap
               </tt>program) It never made it into Solaris, but it was an
          educational experience..</p>
                                                                        
                             
        <p>I haven't touched it for a while, but I'm continually whining
          about the European/simple input-mode usability on Solaris. Maybe
               someday people will listen, and start working on this. To
this     end,           I converted the Openwindows <a
 href="http://www.ireland/%7Etimf/compose.xml">compose-file to an XML    
      format</a> : this was part of a <a
 href="http://www.ireland/%7Etimf/compose-proposal.txt">proposal</a>     
     some of us were putting together to allow for user-defined keyboards
               - this would ease the transition to USB keyboards, taking
some     of           the load off the localisation teams to support every
keyboard     type           available. However, this idea has never really
made it any    further.           Let me know if you're interested in championing 
this  cause...  ( it never really got anywhere )</p>

      <blockquote>                                                      
                                     
        <p>At the moment I deal with <a
 href="http://software.eng/cats/gss/tlis/presentations/img4.html">translation

                 </p>
                                                                        
                
        <p>The TMC Infrastructure/SunTrans project didn't work out       
   that well (the external partner we were dealing with had severe      
    engineering-process problems), and we have been left with a tool    
      that works, but has many limitations. I'm writing translation memory
               tools, along with <a
 href="http://sunweb.ireland/%7Ejc73554">John               Corrigan</a>, 
that aim to fix most of the short-comings in SunTrans.<br>
                 </p>
                                                                        
                                         
        <p>We have already written a comprehensive set of parsers, based
          around <a href="http://www.webgain.com/products/java_cc/">JavaCC</a> 
which     we           use in the current software leveraging functionality 
of SunTrans.               These are more detailed than simply calling the 
i18n message            processing framework, per file-format, instead they 
parse the source               message format itself - which is much more 
useful. Already, these              parsers have found numerous bugs in Sun 
localisation files (eg.              incorrectly formatted messages that the
message compilers missed,              duplicate messages, etc.)<br>
                 </p>
                                                                        
                
        <p>I also wrote an <em>SGML-sensitive sentence segmenter</em> - one
               of the 1st things you need to be able to do in order to reuse
             translations from a previous product (cut a document up into
          sentences).  I have a <a href="./Sgml-segmenter.html">paper about
            this here</a>. I'm not actively maintaining this, but we're planning
               on using a similar technique in the next version of SunTrans.</p>
                                                                        
                             
        <p>At the moment, I'm concentrating on trying to spec out the new
               version of SunTrans, and it's proving quite exciting. We're
 basing   the whole thing on the SunONE software stack - and I already have
 a fair  bit of code running on the Java 2 Enterprise Edition Reference Implementation
    1.3 server. I'm currently working on getting this ported to SunONE Application
    Server 7 as well as writing other pars of the system, such as a HTML
file filter and writing sentence segmenters.</p>

        <p>As a sideline to all this translation technology work, I like to
          keep up to date with desktop technology. I've been running the GNOME
          desktop for a long time (before Sun picked it up) and was     
      maintaining my own Solaris builds of it for a while. These days, I
          don't have the time to do this, but I do every once in a while grab
          tarballs and play around with whatever's new. Interestingly enough,
          I have two brothers who also work at Sun  - both working in the
        <a href="http://www-dt.ireland/">Webtop &amp; Applications Software
           Group</a> Duncan, who's working on StarOffice stuff I think and
         <a href="http://www.gnome.org/%7Egman/photojournal">Glynn</a>, who
          was one of Sun's candidates for the recent GNOME Foundation   
        Elections and hacks on GNOME.</p>
        <p></p><p>
         I wrote an application that changes colours for gtk2 applications. You can

    listed on line.. It's not terribly well sorted, and           all lower 
  case.  I've included any singles I have (preceded by "S -")           as 
 well. Most  of the stuff I have is on cd, but I've about 20 bits        
  of vinyl as  well, and one or two tapes. This list is just music I've 
         bought,  or been given - I'm always happy to listen to new music, 
 and           to  give opinons on anything in the list. Let me know !</p>
                                                                        
                             
        <p>I'm also quite interested in digital photography : I have some 
    of           my <a

    online... I've found <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/photomesa/">photomesa</a>
to be a great image browser (written in java) that suits my needs just nicely.
One of these days, I'm planning on writing a J2EE application to read in
all my photos, and store them in a database according to the .jpg EXIF headers
that my camera ( currently a Sony DSC-S85) creates. There's a library out
there called <a href="http://www.peter-cockerell.net:8080/java/JExif/">Jexif</a>
that I plan on using - all I need now is some time !<br>
