<h1>Building the XLIFF Translation Editor under eclipse</h1>
<h2>Project repository structure</h2>
<br>
The project's structure is a hierarchy of 4 projects which build one
over the other.<br>
The hierarchy is following (all directories are <del>CVS</del><ins>Subversion</ins> root based)<br>
<br>
utilities (in utilities/)<br>
filters (in src/filters) depend on utilities<br>
backconverters (in src/backconverters) depend of filters and utilities<br>
editor (in src/transeditor) depends on all above<br>
<br>
The utilities and filter packages are standalone projects which are
used by other projects.  In order to keep coherent <br>
rest of the tools that we have and that depend on the filters for
example, we decided to release all filters even those not <br>
used by the editor. <br>
<br>
Talking more about the filters, their build process consist of two
build procedures: editor filters build and server side filter build.<br>
The server side filter build consists of all filters, the editor uses
only a fraction of the filters. Also the repository contains code<br>
which is not included in server side nor editor builds, for many
reasons. <br>
<br>
The build scripts which build filters maintain dependency between them,
so if you compile C which depends on B and  B on A<br>
then C will call B's build script and B in turn A's. This way all three
get built.<br>
<br>
Summed up, this means that if you try to import all sources into an IDE
which automatically builds all the classes (like eclipse), you're going<br>
to spend a lot of time setting up filters to include/exclude some
sources.<br>
<br>
<h2>Building with eclipse</h2>
<br>
The first alternative is:<br>
Import all turn AutoBuilding off, use ant script<br>
1. turn auto build off<br>
2. import all<br>
3. use ant build scripts to build the editor (see below)<br>
4. add jars from utilities/jars:<br>
    junit.jar<br>
    swing-layout-1.0.1.jar<br>
    <br>
Second one is:<br>
Use only editor sources build with eclipse or ant.<br>
<br>
1. run 'ant clean transeditor' in <del>CVS</del><ins>Subversion</ins> root dir  (this builds the
editor and installers; it takes a bit too long but we're only doing
this to get the filters and utilities jars<br>
2. create new project<br>
3. exclude all sources except to src/transeditor/src<br>
4. add jars in build/ directory:<br>
    filters-editor.jar<br>
    utilities-editor.jar<br>
    utilities-fuzzytm.jar<br>
    backconv.jar<br>
5. add jars from utilities/jars:<br>
    junit.jar<br>
    swing-layout-1.0.1.jar<br>
6. add src/transeditor/static as library path<br>
7. Do Project -> Build<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Running the editor</h2>
<br>
To make the edit->compile->run/debug faster I suggest you use the
build script in src/transeditor<br>
Target compile compiles the editor (remember you need to run the top
level build script first to get the deps<br>
jars built!)<br>
Target run copies all needed files (like the flag pics) to destination
directory and runs the editor.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you stumble across a problem with code in some of the jars I suggest
you turn off the auto build feature and import the affected sources.<br>
Since most of the code from jar mentioned above can be run standalone,
it's possible to test alone and then integrate. That's the usual
routine.<br>
<br>
<h2>How to debug</h2>
<br>
The easiest way is to run 'ant run' in src/transeditor. The launched
application listens for debugger connection on port 58000. Make your
ide attach<br>
to port 58000 and then you can debug.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>How do we do it ?</h2>
None of us working on the editor is using eclipse. We use netbeans,
where the setup is a bit simple. NB also does not auto build but has
support<br>
for ant (actually it's build system *is* ant), so we decided long time
ago to concentrate on ability to build with ant and not to depend on an
IDE.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Help is welcome</h2>
<br>
I am not an eclipse user, so if you guys are, I'll be glad if you
correct all mistakes I made above. I'll post it onto the project web.<br>
Also any suggestion or help with the project structure, build process
are very much welcome.<br>
<br>
Have fun<br>
