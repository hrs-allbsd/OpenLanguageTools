        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        
        <p>This article, similar to it's <a href="../filters/about-xliff-filters.html">
            companion article about the XLIFF Filters</a>, aims to provide a quick 
            introduction to the Open Language Tools XLIFF Translation Editor. It won't
            go into too many details about how to use the editor, nor will it be a 
            highly technical document to explain how the editor code is structured.
            Instead, it should answer most questions readers unfamiliar with the editor
            are likely to ask.

        <h3>Why have an XLIFF Translation Editor ?</h3>
        
        <p>While it's true that XLIFF is a file format that aims to remove a lot of
        the burdens a translator faces, in particular, keeping track of many 
        different file formats, and knowing which parts of each file format are
        translatable, the XLIFF file itself, at first glance is quite complex.
        To those well-versed in XML, it may not seem too complicated, but the
        format is far from user-friendly.</p>
        
        <p>That's okay though, XLIFF was never intended to be edited directly in
        a text editor : it's unfeasible for a translator to edit an XLIFF file
        directly. Instead, the preferred method is to use
        an editing application that's customised for dealing with XLIFF. Apart from
        just managing the text to be translated, a typical XLIFF editor comes
        bundled with a lot of features that aim to make the task of translating
        XLIFF files a lot less cumbersome than editing the same contents in a 
        a plain text editor.</p>
        
        <a name="what_editor"></a>
        <h3>What is an XLIFF Translation Editor ?</h3>
        
        <p>Simply put, an XLIFF Translation Editor is an application that is 
        tailor-made for translating the contents of XLIFF files. It shows the 
        translator each segment in the file, and marks the various logical states
        of each segment - whether the segment is translated or untranslated, 
        whether or not the segment has had any possible fuzzy translations 
        suggested from other applications that may have processed the XLIFF file
        in the past, and can display additional metadata about the file. It shows
        the source language sentences in a column beside the target language
        sentences, and allows the translator to fill in the correct translation.
        Crucially, the source and target segments are always shown in order, so
        the translator has the full context of the original text.</p>

        </p>
        
        <p>It might be worth going into a little more detail on the feature list
        of the Open Language Tools XLIFF Translation Editor so that readers can
        get a better idea of it's functionality :<p>
        
        
        <h4>Segment highlighting</h4>
        <p>Segments being viewed and edited are colour coded, showing which
        sections of the segment are normal text, and which are formatting elements
        (for example, HTML markup)</p>
        
        <h4>Projects</h4>
        <p>The editor has a concept of "Projects", that is, any editing session
        is a member of a particular project - this could be a set of related files
        that a translator is currently working on. The project is particularly 
        important when it comes to managing the "Mini TM"</p>
                
        <h4>"Mini TM"</h4>
        <p>The "Mini TM" is a central part of the XLIFF Translation Editor. It
        is the basis for a number of features that are mentioned below, but in
        a nutshell, it is a simple file-based database that holds all source
        language and target language segments that have been translated in the
        current project. It's automatically updated with any changes that happen
        to segments that are being edited in the editor. There is an option on
        the menu to allow the translator to directly edit the contents of the
        Mini TM.</p>
        
        <h4>Repetition handling</h4>
        <p>Using the Mini TM, as soon as the translator navigates to a segment
        which matches a segment that has already been translated using the 
        editor and exists in the Mini TM, that segment is automatically copied
        to the target area.</p>
        
        <h4>Fuzzy matches</h4>
        <p>Similar to Repetition handling, the Mini TM will also do fuzzy matching
        against the current segment being translated. Here, the editor displays
        a "close" translation for the current string being translated in an area
        at the bottom of the screen, highlighting the differences between the 
        source of the suggested translation, and the actual sentence being 
        translated. When available, the fuzzy match window will also show the
        context of the suggested translation (eg. what file it was in, or any
        other related information about the sentence)</p>
        
        <h4>Translation status</h4>
        <p>At a glance, a translator can tell the status of any segment that is
        displayed in the translation editor. Different icons are used to display
        user-translations, Mini TM translations, reviewed, unreviewed and
        problematic segments.</p>
        
        <h4>Notes</h4>
        <p>The editor has a mechanism to display notes that may have been embedded
        in the source document to the translator. Typically, these are comments
        from software message file formats, like <code>po files(gettext)</code>
        but also, they could be comments from other translators who have worked
        on that file in the past - perhaps explaining why a particular translation
        was used. These notes can be applied per-sentence or can be applied to
        the entire file</p>
        
        <h4>Convert to original</h4>
        <p>The editor allows the translator to convert the XLIFF file to it's
            original file format at any time. This allows the translator to view
            the source file as it would be rendered on screen if required. The
            convert to original dialog also has an option to create a TMX file from 
            the XLIFF file, to import it into a TM system, if required.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Format checking</h4>
        <p>The editor has a format checking function, which compares any
        formatting in the source sentence with formatting in the target sentence,
        if required.</p>
        
        <h4>Easy navigation</h4>
        <p>An intrinsic feature of the editor, but one often overlooked, is that
        the editor provides several ways to navigate around the translated document.
        Apart from using the mouse and buttons, there are also numerous shortcut
        keys which are configurable by the user. There is also a "fast access"
        list, which changes the way the "Next Segment" and "Previous Segment"
        actions work. The "fast access" menu allows user to jump to the
        Next/Previous :
        <ul>
            <li>Untranslated sentence</li>
            <li>Translated sentence</li>
            <li>Reviewed sentence</li>
            <li>Unreviewed sentence</li>
            <li>Fuzzy match</li>
            <li>Exact match</li>
            <li>User translation</li>
        </ul>
         

        <h4>Print file</h4>
        <p>The editor allows a translator to produce a HTML version of the file
        being translated that is suitable for printing and review outside the
        editor (which can sometimes be useful if they need to get away from the
        computer screen !)</p>
        
        <h4>Spell checking</h4>
        <p>The editor allows users to run a spell checker on the translated
            content.
