        <h1>Open Language Tools XLIFF Translation Editor Quickstart Guide</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This document serves as a quickstart guide for the Open Language Tools
            XLIFF Translation Editor. We also have a complete
            <a href="http://java.net/projects/open-language-tools/downloads"> <!-- OLT_XLIFF_Translation_Editor_Manual_1_0.pdf -->
            User's Manual</a> available, which goes into a lot of detail on the
            rest of the editor's functions. This document should be enough for
            you to get started.
        </p>
  
        <h2>Installation</h2>
  
        <p>To install the XLIFF Translation Editor, first download the latest release of 
        Java. The editor requires at least release 1.4.2 <small><a href="#note">
        (see note)</a></small>.
        These can be obtained at
        <a href="http://java.com">http://java.com</a> - follow the link on the
        main page to obtain Java for your platform.

        <p>Next you should download the appropriate binary of the editor which
            is available on <a href="http://java.net/projects/open-language-tools/downloads/directory/releases">
            the Releases section of our web site</a>, (or you could even 
            <a href="xliff-editor-build.html">build them yourself</a>!).
        </p>
        <p>We have builds for two platforms - the contents are similar for
            each platform, but the installation actions are slightly different
            to account for platform differences.
        </p>
        <p>Note that right now, we only have spell
            checkers available for Solaris and Windows - these are based on the
            open source Aspell spell checkers, and are platform specific : we
            will migrate to a Java implementation (probably JSpell) in the future
            so that we don't need to worry about doing Windows, Solaris, Linux,
            Mac OS X, etc. builds. If you're running a UNIX-like OS other than Solaris/SPARC
            then you should install the "_sol" version of the editor, but the
            spell checking functionality will not work, sorry!
            
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Windows : transeditor_v1_0_win.zip</li>
            <li>UNIX (including Mac OS X) : transeditor_v1_0_sol.tar.gz</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Download the file for your platform and extract it from it's archive.
            Having done that, then either double-click the <code>.jar</code> file
            or issue the command <code>java -jar transeditor_v1_0_sol.jar</code>
            or <code>java -jar transeditor_v1_0_win.jar</code> which will then
            launch the installer program.
        </p>
        <p>The installer program will ask you to accept a
            license and then ask you to enter a location to install the software.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Running the XLIFF Translation Editor</h2>
        
        <p>Launch the editor either by double-clicking the desktop launcher,
            going to the <em>"Start"</em> menu in Windows and selecting the launcher for the
            editor, or by running the <code>translation.sh</code> or <code>translation.bat</code>
            scripts from the command line. You should see the following application
            appear :
        </p>
        
        <p><center>
        <a href="quickstart-images/editor-quickstart-transid.png">
        <img src="quickstart-images/editor-quickstart-transid-small.png"
        alt="Editor showing translator ID dialog"/></a></center></p>
        
        <p>Here you should just enter any identifier that you wish to use as your
            translator id - this gets saved in the XLIFF file, so that you can keep
            track of which translator has translated which segment in the file.
        </p>
        
        <p>Next, you should start a new project. Click on the <code>
            File-&gt;New Project</code> menu option, and this dialog will appear :
        </p>
        
        <p><center><a href="quickstart-images/editor-quickstart-project.png">
        <img src="quickstart-images/editor-quickstart-project-small.png"
        alt="Editor showing new project dialog"/></a></center></p>
        
        <p>Choose a name for your project, and select the source and target
        languages.</p>
        
        <p>Next, you can open an XLIFF file using the <code>File-&gt;Open</code>
        menu option. If the file hasn't been opened by the editor before, it
        may not have a target language assigned yet, in which case it will display
        a warning dialog - in our implementation, each XLIFF file can only have 
        one target language.</p>
        
        <p><center><a href="quickstart-images/editor-quickstart-openfile.png">
        <img src="quickstart-images/editor-quickstart-openfile-small.png"
        alt="Editor showing file open dialog"/></a></center></p>
        
        <p>Now, you can commence translating the strings on the left pane of
        the editor. When you're finished, mark the segments as translated, save
        the file, and choose the <code>Tools->Convert to Original</code>
        menu option, which converts the XLIFF file back to it's original file
        format :
        
        <p><center><a href="quickstart-images/editor-translate+backconv-openfile.png">
        <img src="quickstart-images/editor-quickstart-translate+backconv-small.png"
        alt="Editor showing backconversion dialog"/></a></center></p>
                
        <p>Much (much) more information about using the Open Language Tools XLIFF
        Translation Editor can be found in the<a href="http://java.net/projects/open-language-tools/downloads/directory/documents"><!-- OLT_XLIFF_Translation_Editor_Manual_1_0.pdf -->
        User Manual</a>.</p>
        
        <h2>Configuring the XLIFF Translation Editor</h2>
        
        <p>The editor has many keyboard shortcuts and options that can be
            configured directly using the items in the <code>Options</code> menu.
            If you prefer, you can also change the alignment of the panes showing the
            segments by choosing the <code>View-&gt;Window Arrangement</code> menu
            items.
        </p>

        <small>The Open Language Tools XLIFF Translation Editor has been written and tested
            with the Sun implementation of Java 2 Standard Edition 1.4.2 and it is
            known to work with the Sun Java 5 implementation. Other Java implementations
            may also work, but we haven't tested them. If you run the editor on
            different Java implementations, let us know and we'll update this page !
