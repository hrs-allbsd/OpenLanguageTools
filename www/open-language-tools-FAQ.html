  <h4><a name="q1" id="q1">1. What are the Open Language Tools used
  for ?</a></h4>

  <p>As mentioned in the <a href=
  "index.html#description">description</a>
  on the project home page, the Open Language Tools are a set of
  applications intended to make it easy for people to translate
  software and documentation into many different natural languages.
  They are based around common industry standards such as XLIFF and
  TMX and are implemented in Java</p>

  <h4><a name="q2" id="q2">2. Why did Sun open source the Open
  Language Tools ?</a></h4>

  <p>These reasons were listed in the <!-- <a href=
  "https://open-language-tools.dev.java.net/servlets/NewsItemView?newsItemID=2237"> -->
  <a href="http://java.net/projects/open-language-tools/lists/announce/archive/2005-05/message/0">
  initial announcement</a> posted on creation of this java.net
  project. To summarise :</p>

  <p>Sun had a set of translation tools developed in-house that
  were being successfully used to translate Sun software and
  documentation. They felt that the tools had reached a state where
  they could be used effectively outside the company. Since Sun are
  not a translation tools provider, they were not interested in
  selling and supporting these tools, so they decided to release
  them to the public.</p>

  <p>In addition, Sun works with a number of open source projects
  which are involved in translation activities and since Sun
  includes these projects in some of their products, it made sense
  for hem to release these tools in order to help out those
  translation communities.</p>

  <p>If more people start to use these tools, it will be easier for
  Sun to reuse community translatable content. At the same time,
  the translation communities could be more productive using these
  tools, directly benefiting the open source project - Everyone
  Wins !</p>

  <p>Finally, Sun have had a long history of supporting open
  standards : XLIFF and TMX are two of the standards being used in
  the translation industry, yet there are very few free
  implementations of tools which employ these standards. By
  releasing these tools, Sun hopes to address that problem.</p>

  <h4><a name="q3" id="q3">3. What license is this code released
  under ?</a></h4>

  <p>The Open Language Tools are released under the terms of the
  <!-- <a href="http://www.sun.com/cddl/cddl.html"> --><a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/cddl1.php">Common Development
  and Distribution License</a> (CDDL).</p>

  <h4><a name="q4" id="q4">4. What file formats do you support
  ?</a></h4>

  <p>Initially, the following file formats are supported, but we
  hope to expand this list as the project matures :</p>

  <p><strong>Documentation file types</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>HTML</li>

    <li>Docbook SGML</li>

    <li>JSP</li>

    <li>XML (generic - needs a configuration file for each XML
    type)</li>

    <li>OpenOffice.org : sxw, sxc, sxi</li>

    <li>Open Document Format : odt, ods, odp, odg</li>

    <li>Plain text</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Software file types</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>PO/POT (gettext)</li>

    <li>Mozilla .DTD resource files</li>
  </ul>

  <h4><a name="q5" id="q5">5. How can I help this project
  ?</a></h4>

  <p>We've got a <a href=
  "index.html#help">big list</a> of
  the areas that we'd like help with on our <a href=
  "index.html">project home page</a>
  we'd be absolutely thrilled to have you along as a member of this
  project!</p>

  <h4><a name="q6" id="q6">6. What are XLIFF and TMX ?</a></h4>

  <p><a href=
  "http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/xliff/documents/xliff-specification.htm">
  XLIFF</a> and TMX are localisation industry-standard file formats
  used during the translation process.</p>

  <p>XLIFF is a container-format expressed in XML that allows us to
  abstract translatable from non-translatable content from a source
  file format, and track the various pieces of metadata that are
  produced during the translation process (eg. word count, notes to
  translators, translation review status, etc.) Once a file has
  been converted to XLIFF, it can be processed by any tool that
  understands the XLIFF format (rather than each tool needing to be
  customised to support the original file type). More information
  is available in <a href=
  "filters/about-xliff-filters.html">
  About The XLIFF Filters</a>.</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.lisa.org/tmx/">TMX</a> is related to
  XLIFF, but instead of being a container format that contains the
  state of a file in translation, it's a format that was designed
  for the interchange of completed translations, (sometimes called
  translation memory data) between tools. You could think of a TMX
  file being the final representation of a set of translated
  material that can then be poured into a database for future
  reuse.</p>

  <p>The Open Language Tools project includes a way to convert
  XLIFF files that contain completed and reviewed translations into
  TMX files.</p>

  <h4><a name="q7" id="q7">7. What are the XLIFF filters ?</a></h4>

  <p>The XLIFF filters are a set of programs/libraries that can
  convert several different source file formats to XLIFF. There is
  more information about the filters in the article <a href=
  "filters/about-xliff-filters.html">
  About The XLIFF Filters</a>.</p>

  <h4><a name="q8" id="q8">8. What is the XLIFF Translation Editor
  ?</a></h4>

  <p>The XLIFF Translation Editor is a full-featured editing
  application built to process XLIFF files. Think of it as a
  customised word-processor for doing translation. It has a number
  of features that are aimed at improving translator efficiency.
  There is more information about the editor in the article
  <a href="editor/about-xliff-editor.html">
  About the XLIFF Editor</a>.</p>

  <p>A <a href=
  "http://blogs.sun.com/roller/resources/timf/editor-demo.html">live
  demo of the XLIFF Translation Editor</a> can be seen on Tim's Web
  Log. (note that this is a slightly older version of the editor,
  with the old Sun branding)</p>

  <h4><a name="q9" id="q9">9. What platforms will the Open Language
  Tools run on ?</a></h4>

  <p>The Open Language Tools are developed and used on a mixture of
  platforms including Solaris, Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. We aim
  to provide cross-platform compatibility with any J2SE 1.4.2
  compliant JVM.</p>

  <h4><a name="q10" id="q10">10. Will the Open Language Tools
  compile/run on non-Sun Java implementations ?</a></h4>

  <p>Possibly. The Open Language Tools were developed and tested
  using the Sun J2SE 1.4.2 release of Java - it's possible that
  they will work using one of the other Java implementations. We
  would be very interested in getting the tools to run on these
  other Java implementations, but it's not the main focus of our
  project - see <a href=
  "index.html#philosophy">Philosophy</a></p>

  <p>We haven't yet upgraded any of our code to take advantage of
  new features introduced in the J2SE 5.0 release of Java.</p>

  <h4><a name="q11" id="q11">11. Can I use these tools in a
  commercial setting ?</a></h4>

  <p>Yes, of course you can - the only requirements here, are the
  terms of the <!-- <a href=
  "http://www.sun.com/cddl/cddl.html">--> <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/cddl1.php">CDDL</a>. There is a <!-- <a href=
  "http://www.opensolaris.org/faq/licensing_faq.html"> --><a href="http://hub.opensolaris.org/bin/view/Main/licensing_faq">CDDL FAQ</a>
  on the <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org">OpenSolaris</a> web
  site that you may also find useful.</p>

  <p>If you are using these tools commercially, drop us a mail and
  let us know - we'd love to hear any feedback you might have !</p>

  <h4><a name="q12" id="q12">12. Where can I get the Open Language
  Tools ?</a></h4>

  <p>On our project home page, in the <a href=
  "http://java.net/projects/open-language-tools/downloads">
  Documents &amp; Files section</a> we have binaries for the
  components we have released so far. If you want to get access to
  our <del>CVS</del><ins>Subversion</ins>, then you should <a href=
  "http://java.net/projects/open-language-tools/watch">
  join our project as an Observer</a> - if you've got some code to
  submit back, get in touch with us, and we can chat about giving
  you Developer rights to the <del>CVS</del><ins>Subversion</ins> tree.</p>

  <h4><a name="q13" id="q13">13. Why isn't my language listed in
  the logo ?</a></h4>

  <p>I don't know what <em>"Open Language Tools"</em> is in your
  language ! The plan with the logo is to eventually have lots and
  lots of different versions of the logo, each with the same basic
  elements - that is, the book motif, the "Open Language Tools"
  title, and the URL to our web pages.</p>

  <p>People can then add four of five different translations of
  "Open Language Tools" to appear in the background. Ultimately,
  it'd be nice if our project home page had some clever JavaScript
  to randomly pick one of these logos to display : if you know some
  clever JavaScript, or can contribute additional translations,
  then let us know !</p>

  <h4><a name="q14" id="q14">14. How can I translate the Open
  Language Tools ?</a></h4>

  <p>Well, as mentioned <a href=
  "index.html#help">here</a> on our
  project home page, one of the areas we ultimately would like help
  on this project, is to provide translations of the Editor and
  Filter's user interface. Unfortunately at the moment, some of our
  tools are in the embarassing position of not being correctly
  internationalised ! As <a href=
  "http://www.alanis.com/main.html">Alanis Morisette</a> would say,
  isn't it ironic... don't you think ?</p>

  <p>The problem is, that we haven't wrapped many of the
  user-visible strings in calls to methods of <a href=
  "http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/ResourceBundle.html">
  <code>java.util.ResourceBundle</code></a>, allowing the source
  code to get to a state where it's messages can be translated.</p>

  <p>So far, we can you can translate the <a href=
  "http://java.net/projects/open-language-tools/sources/svn/content/trunk/src/filters/gui/src/org/jvnet/olt/filters/gui/XliffFilterGUIMessages.properties">
  message file</a> for the XLIFF Filter GUI, but that's all for now
  - if you want to translate it, feel free - mail me your
  translations, and I'll pop it into <del>CVS</del><ins>Subversion</ins> and give you a big credit
  in the <a href=
  "http://java.net/projects/open-language-tools/sources/svn/content/trunk/AUTHORS">
  AUTHORS</a> file !</p>

  <p>Otherwise, if you're really eager, you could translate our
  documentation or the contents of our website. If you'd like to
  help out with the internationalisation work on the code, let us
  know - we'd love the support !</p>
