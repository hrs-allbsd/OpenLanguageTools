        <h4><a name="q1">1. What are the Open Language Tools used for ?</a></h4>
        <p>As mentioned in the
            <a href="http://open-language-tools.dev.java/#description">description</a>
            on the project home page, the Open Language Tools are a set of applications
            intended to make it easy for people to translate sofware and 
            documentation into many different natural languages. They are based
            around common industry standards such as XLIFF and TMX and are implemented
            in Java
        </p>
  
        
        <h4><a name="q2">2. Why did Sun open source the Open Language Tools ?</a></h4>
        <p>These reasons were listed in the
        <a href="https://open-language-tools.dev.java.net/servlets/NewsItemView?newsItemID=2237">
        inital announcement</a> posted on creation of this java.net project.
        To summarise :</p>
        
        <p>Sun had a set of translation tools developed in-house that were being
        successfully used to translate Sun software and documentation. They felt
        that the tools had reached a state where they could be used effectively
        outside the company. Since Sun are not a translation tools provider, they
        were not interested in selling and supporting these tools, so they decided
        to release them to the public.

        <p>In addition, Sun works with a number of open source projects which are
            involved in translation activities and since Sun includes these projects
            in some of their products, it made sense for hem to release these tools
            in order to help out those translation communities.
        </p>
        
        <p>If more people start to use these tools, it will be easier for Sun to
            reuse community translatable content. At the same time, the translation
            communities could be more productive using these tools, directly 
            benefiting the open source project - Everyone Wins !
        </p>                
        
        <p>Finally, Sun have had a long history of supporting open standards :
            XLIFF and TMX are two of the standards being used in the translation
            industry, yet there are very few free implementations of tools which
            employ these standards. By releasing these tools, Sun hopes to address
            that problem.
        </p>
  
        
        <h4><a name="q3">3. What license is this code released under ?</a></h4>
        <p>The Open Language Tools are released under the terms of the
            <a href="http://www.sun.com/cddl/cddl.html">Common Development and
            Distribution License</a>(CDDL).
        </p>
        
        
  
        <h4><a name="q4">4. What file formats do you support ?</a></h4>
        <p>Initially, the following file formats are supported, but we hope to
        expand this list as the project matures :</p>
        
        <p><strong>Documentation file types</strong></p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>Docbook SGML</li>
            <li>JSP</li>
            <li>XML (generic - needs a configuration file for each XML type)</li>
            <li>OpenOffice.org : sxw, sxc, sxi</li>
            <li>Plain text</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Software file types</strong></p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>PO/POT (gettext)</li>
            <li>Msg/tmsg (catgets)</li>
            <li>Java .properties</li>
            <li>Java ResourceBundle</li>
            <li>Mozilla .DTD resource files</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        
        
        <h4><a name="q5">5. How can I help this project ?</a></h4>
        <p>We've got a <a href="http://open-language-tools.dev.java.net#help">
            big list</a> of the areas that we'd like help with on our 
            <a href="http://open-language-tools.dev.java.net">project home page</a>
            we'd be absolutely thrilled to have you along as a member of this project!       
        </p>
  
        
        <h4><a name="q6">6. What are XLIFF and TMX ?</a></h4>
        <p>
        <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/xliff/documents/xliff-specification.htm">
        XLIFF</a> and TMX are localisation industry-standard file formats used during
        the translation process.

        <p>XLIFF is a container-format expressed in XML that allows us to abstract
        translatable from non-translatable content from a source file format, 
        and track the various pieces of metadata that are produced during the 
        translation process
        (eg. word count, notes to translators, translation review status, etc.)
        Once a file has been converted to XLIFF, it can be processed by any tool
        that understands the XLIFF format (rather than each tool needing to be
        customised to support the original file type). More information is
        available in
        <a href="https://open-language-tools.dev.java.net/filters/about-xliff-filters.html">
        About The XLIFF Filters</a>.</p>
        
        <p><a href="http://www.lisa.org/tmx/">TMX</a> is related to XLIFF, but 
            instead of being a container format that contains the state of a file in
            translation, it's a format that was designed for the interchange of 
            completed translations, (sometimes called translation memory data) between 
            tools. You could think of a TMX file being the final representation of a
            set of translated material that can then be poured into a database for 
            future reuse.        
        </p>
        <p>The Open Language Tools project includes a way to convert XLIFF files
            that contain completed and reviewed translations into TMX files.
        </p>
        
        
        <h4><a name="q7">7. What are the XLIFF filters ?</a></h4>
        <p> The XLIFF filters are a set of programs/libraries that can convert
            several different source file formats to XLIFF. There is more information
            about the filters in the article 
            <a href="https://open-language-tools.dev.java.net/filters/about-xliff-filters.html">
            About The XLIFF Filters</a>.        
        </p>
        
        <h4><a name="q8">8. What is the XLIFF Translation Editor ?</a></h4>
        <p>The XLIFF Translation Editor is a full-featured editing application
        built to process XLIFF files. Think of it like a customised word-processor
        for doing translation. It has a number of features that are aimed at
        improving translator efficiency.<em>(need to write an article expanding
        on this in detail, as I did for the XLIFF Filters above)</em>
        <p>A <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/resources/timf/editor-demo.html">
        live demo of the XLIFF Translation Editor</a> can be seen on Tim's Web
        Log.</p>
        
        
        <h4><a name="q9">9. What platforms will the Open Language Tools run on ?
        </a></h4>
        <p>The Open Language Tools are developed and used on a mixture of
            platforms including Solaris, Windows, Mac OS X and Linx. We aim to provide
            cross-platform compatibility with any J2SE 1.4.2 compliant JVM.
        </p>
        
        
        <h4><a name="q10">10. Will the Open Language Tools compile/run on non-Sun Java
        implementations ?</a></h4>
        <p>
        Possibly. The Open Language Tools were developed and tested using the Sun 
        J2SE 1.4.2 release of Java - it's possible that they will work using one 
        of the other Java implementations. We would be very interested in getting
        the tools to run on these other Java implementation, but it's not the main
        focus of our project - see <a href="http://open-language-tools.dev.java.net/#philosophy">
        Philosophy</a>
        <p>We haven't yet upgraded any of our code to take advantage of new
            features introduced in the J2SE 5.0 release of Java.
        </p>

        
        <h4><a name="q11">11. Can I use these tools in a commercial setting ?</a></h4>
        <p>Yes, of course you can - the only requirements here, are the terms of
        the <a href="http://www.sun.com/cddl/cddl.html">CDDL</a>. For example, the
        CDDL states that if you make any source code changes to any code found in
        this project, you must contribute your changes back to this project. 
        There is a 
        <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/faq/licensing_faq.html">CDDL FAQ</a>
        on the <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org">OpenSolaris</a> web site 
        that you may also find useful.</p>
        <p>
            If you are using these tools commercially, drop us a mail and let us know
            - we'd love to hear any feedback you might have !
