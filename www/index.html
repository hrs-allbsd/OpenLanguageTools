<h3>Project Description</h3>

<p>The Open Language Tools are a set of translation tools that aim to make the
task of translating software and documentation a lot easier. Initially,
they comprise of a full-featured XLIFF Translation Editor and a set of XLIFF
file-filters for a number of documentation and software file formats.
</p>

<p>Our intended audience is translators of software and documentation - both
professional translators and those just doing it for kicks !</p>
<p>
The current list of supported file formats is :
</p>

<p><strong>Documentation file types</strong>
</p><ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>Docbook SGML</li>
<li>XML (generic - needs a configuration file for each XML type)</li>
<li>OpenOffice.org : sxw, sxc, sxi</li>
<li>plain text</li>
</ul>

<strong>Software file types</strong>
<ul>
<li>PO (gettext)</li>
<li>msg/tmsg (catgets)</li>
<li>Java .properties</li>
<li>Java ResourceBundle</li>
<li>Mozilla .DTD resource files</li>
</ul>

in particular, can be seen over on <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/timf/">

<h3>Philosophy</h3>

<p>We believe that computers are tools that should help people - in our case, we
want computers to help translators. Anything that can be done to help them improve 
the quality of their work, or reduce the amount of time it takes to do translation
is definitely within the scope of this project. We strongly believe in the value
of shared open standards - everything we do should be based on open standards, 
and should interoperate via those standards. Finally, taking a leaf from the OpenSolaris
developers, we strive for <em>FCS Quality All The Time!</em></p>


<h3>Releases</h3>

<p>As there's no code available in the Open Language Tools project <strong>yet</strong>,
we don't have any releases. (For what it's worth, inside Sun, the XLIFF Editor
was at release 4.5 and was still being actively developed before we decided to
open source it) All development of the editor will now take place within the
Open Language Tools project.</p>


<h3>Call for help !</h3>

<p>We're interested in people working with us at <strong>all</strong> levels, 
there's mailing lists set up for developers and users and we've got an 
issue-tracking system that it waiting to be filled with bug reports !</p>

<p>Here's a few categories you as a member of the Open Language Tools project 
might fall into - these are all areas that we need help in, so we'd love to have
you work in any (or all, if you're super talented!) of these categories :</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Users</strong> - Do you use translation tools ? We'd love to hear your 
<a href="mailto:users@open-language-tools.dev.java.net">feedback !</a></li>

<li><strong>Testers</strong> - Do you think we've got bugs in our tools ? 
<a href="mailto:users@open-language-tools.dev.java.net">let us know</a> 
(and <a href="https://open-language-tools.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">
file an issue</a> at the same time !) <small>I'm still working on configuring the
issue tracker</small></li>

<li><strong>GUI Developers</strong> - are you proficient in Swing, if so the Translation Editor <a href="mailto:dev@open-language-tools.dev.java.net">could use your help</a>.</li>

<li><strong>Filter Developers</strong> - maybe you're a command-line junkie (like me) or you're
an expert in file formats we don't yet cover, you might be interested in looking
at the XLIFF Filters : <a href="mailto:dev@open-language-tools.dev.java.net">drop
us a mail</a></li>

<li><strong>i18n Developers</strong> - while everything we do in the Open Language
Tools is based around Unicode, we haven't yet written proper messaging-handling
support into our code, so are in the embarassing situation of writing translation
tools that can't actually be translated ! We 
<a href="mailto:dev@open-language-tools.dev.java.net">need your help !</a></li>

<li><strong>Technical writers</strong> - think you can do a better job documenting
our software ? (probably not too hard!)
Please, let us know ! We don't have much
<a href="https://open-language-tools.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">
documentation</a> at the moment.</li>

<li><strong>Translators</strong> - apart from being the experts in translation
tools, maybe you'd like to work translating our software or documentation into 
other languages ? <a href="mailto:dev@open-language-tools.dev.java.net">Send us
email</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I'm sure there's other areas we need help in - in fact, maybe we need help in
determining <em>where</em> we need help !</p> We'd really appreciate your input.
