<p>The Open Language Tools are a set of translation tools that aim to make the
    task of translating software and documentation a lot easier. Initially,
    they comprise of a full-featured XLIFF Translation Editor and a set of XLIFF
    file-filters for a number of documentation and software file formats.
</p>

<p>Our intended audience is tools developers and translators of software and 
    documentation - both professional translators and those just doing it for
    kicks !
</p>
   
<p>
    The current list of supported file formats is :
</p>

<p><strong>Documentation file types</strong></p>
<p><ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>Docbook SGML</li>
    <li>JSP</li>
    <li>XML (generic - needs a configuration file for each XML type)</li>
    <li>OpenOffice.org : sxw, sxc, sxi</li>
    <li>Open Document Format : odw, odc, odi</li>
    <li>Plain text</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><strong>Software file types</strong></p>
<p><ul>
    <li>PO (gettext)</li>
    <li>Msg/tmsg (catgets)</li>
    <li>Java .properties</li>
    <li>Java ResourceBundle</li>
    <li>Mozilla .DTD resource files</li>
</ul>
</p>

<!-- blockquoting this so that it stands out, this captures the way our project
     thinks about things. Might want to work on the wording a bit here, but this
     is a good start.
--><a name="philosophy"></a>
<h4>Philosophy</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>We believe that computers are tools that can help people - in our case,
    we want computers to help translators. Anything that can be done to help translators   
    improve the quality of their work, or reduce the amount of time it takes to 
    do translation is definitely within the scope of this project. We strongly 
    believe in the value of shared open standards - everything we do should be 
    based on open standards, and should interoperate via those standards.</p>
    <p>Lastly writing translation tools is a noble cause : we believe that we should be
        doing all we can to break down the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_divide">
        Digital divide</a>, and language is one aspect of that. If you can't use
        a computer because it's not translated to your native language, then
        we want to provide tools to fix that problem.
    </p>

<!-- Why would people want to work on the Open Language Tools project ? -->
<a name="help"></a>
<h3>Call for help !</h3>

<p>We're interested in people working with us at <strong>all</strong> levels. 
There are mailing lists set up for developers and users, and we have an 
issue-tracking system that is waiting to be filled with bug reports.</p>

<p>Here's a few categories you as a member of the Open Language Tools project 
might fall into - these are all areas that we need help in, so we'd love to have
you work in any (or all, if you're super talented!) of these categories :</p>

<ul>

    <li><p><strong>Users</strong> - Do you use translation tools ? We'd love to 
    hear your <a href="mailto:users@open-language-tools.dev.java.net">
    feedback</a></p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Testers</strong> - Our tools have bugs in them and you can 
    help find them and gain the undying gratitude of users and developers alike !
    <a href="mailto:users@open-language-tools.dev.java.net">Let us know if you 
    can help</a> (and 
    <a href="https://open-language-tools.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">
    file an issue</a> at the same time !) <small>(I'm still working on 
    configuring the issue tracker)</small></p></li>

    <li><p><strong>GUI Developers</strong> - Are you proficient in Swing, if so the 
    Translation Editor <a href="mailto:dev@open-language-tools.dev.java.net">could 
    use your help</a>.</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Filter Developers</strong> - Maybe you're a command-line junkie 
    (like me) or you're an expert in file formats we don't yet cover, you might 
    be interested in looking at the XLIFF Filters, please 
    <a href="mailto:dev@open-language-tools.dev.java.net">drop us a mail</a></p></li>

    <li><p><strong>i18n Developers</strong> - While everything we do in the Open
    Language Tools project is based around Unicode, we haven't yet written proper
    messaging-handling support into our code, so we're in the embarassing
    situation of writing translation tools that can't actually be translated ! We 
    <a href="mailto:dev@open-language-tools.dev.java.net">need your help !</a></p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Technical writers</strong> - Think you can do a better job documenting
    our software ? (probably not too hard) Please, let us know - we don't have much
    <a href="https://open-language-tools.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">
    documentation</a> at the moment.</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Translators</strong> - Apart from being <em>the</em> experts in translation
    tools, maybe you'd like to try translating our software or documentation into 
    other languages ? <a href="mailto:dev@open-language-tools.dev.java.net">Send us
    email</a> - but before you do that,
    <a href="http://open-language-tools.dev.java.net/open-language-tools-FAQ.html#q13">
    read this FAQ first !</a></p></li>
    
    <li><p><strong>Graphics designers</strong> - Our project lacks good icons and 
    graphical elements, and our home page contains just text. Perhaps you'd like 
    to help brighten things up ? <a href="mailto:dev@open-language-tools.dev.java.net">
    Talk to us</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>I'm sure there's other areas we need help in - in fact, maybe we need help in
determining <em>where</em> we need help <code>:-)</code></p> 
<p>We'd really appreciate your input : you're welcome and encouraged to join project
Open Language Tools as an Observer - if you've got cool stuff to submit back to us,
we can definitely chat about making you a Developer.</p>
