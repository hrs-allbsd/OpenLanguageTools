        <!-- Introduction -->
        <a name="introduction"></a>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>This document lists some of the notable sections of the source code in the
            Open Language Tools XLIFF Filters <del>CVS</del><ins>Subversion</ins> repository, explains what they
            contain and notes some details about them. It's purpose is to act as
            a guide to developers looking at the source tree for the first time.
            While the code itself is already quite well documented, there's been
            no documentation so far that explains the entire source code at a
            high level. This document aims to do that.
        </p>
        
        <p>It's arguable that the contents of this document should also be
            rolled into the package-level javadoc comments in the source code as
            well.
        </p>
        
        <a name="toplevel"></a>
        <h3>Top Level build directory</h3>
        <p>The top level build directory contains the main ant build files.
            The <code>build.xml</code> file contains the main targets that initiate
            the building of the XLIFF Filters. The <code>common.xml</code> file
            is used by <em>all</em> build files in the workspace. It defines common
            targets to compile the workspace contents and also includes a set of
            dependencies that can be referenced from the child build scripts (e.g.
            we only need to declare the location of jars once
            in this common build file, and then all of the other scripts can
            reference this one. <code>build.ant.properties</code> and
            <code>common.properties</code> contains some variables that
            developers may want to change before compilation.
        </p>
        
        <!-- Utilities directory -->
        <a name="utilities"></a>
        <h3>Utilities</h3>
        <p>The utilities directory contains source code and libraries used by
            both the XLIFF Filters and the XLIFF Translation Editor. In the following
            sections, we'll go into more detail about some of the subdirectories
            under <code>utilities/</code>
        </p>

        <a name="general"></a>
        <h4>general/</h4>
        <p>General contains some common classes - methods for keeping track of
            supported locales and codesets, some classes to wrap XML characters
            when reading and writing them and some abstractions used to deal with
            XLIFF files.        
        </p>
    
        <a name="jars"></a>
        <h4>jars/</h4>
        <p>This area of the workspace contains third party libraries and
            applications that are used by the rest of the components in the workspace.
            Users are recommended to read the <code>LICENSE.txt</code> file, which
            contains the licence terms for these libraries.
        </p>
    
        <a name="messageformat_parser"></a>
        <h4>messageformat_parser/</h4>
        <p>The MessageFormatParser is a JavaCC/JJTree parser that reads text
            that has been marked up for use by the methods provided by the
            <code>java.text.MessageFormat</code> class. Using this parser, and some
            code we'll mention later, we are
            able to wrap java ResourceBundle files which contain MessageFormat
            markup with XLIFF <code>&lt;mrk&gt;</code> elements.
        </p>
        
        <a name="non-conformant_sgml_doc_fragment"></a>
        <h4>non-conformant_sgml_doc_fragment/</h4>
        <p>The NonConformantSgmlDocFragmentParser is a JavaCC/JJTree parser that
            recognise sections of sgml-like text. It's called "non-conformant" since it
            is not strict about what it accepts as sgml-like text : quite often
            HTML files, for example, do not contain correct tagging. This class
            provides the file-parsing functionality of the HTML to XLIFF converter,
            and is also used elsewhere in the XLIFF filters and XLIFF Translation
            Editor.
        </p>
    
        <a name="printf_parser"></a>
        <h4>printf_parser/</h4>
        <p>The PrintfParser, like the MessageFormatParser, is a JavaCC/JJTree
            parser can recognise printf/gettext markup. Using this parser, and some
            code we'll mention later, we can wrap strings containing printf
            statements with XLIFF <code>&lt;mrk&gt;</code> elements.
        </p>
    
        <a name="sgml_doc_fragment"></a>
        <h4>sgml_doc_fragment/</h4>
        <p>The SgmlDocFragmentParser is a stricter form of the NonConformantSgmlDocFragmentParser.
            It's used as the underlying file parser for the SGML to XLIFF filter. Importantly
            this is <em>not</em> a full-blown SGML parser in the correct sense of the
            word. More accurately, it's a lexer than can recognise SGML constructions
            such as elements, comments, entity declarations, doctype declarations, etc.
        </p>
    
        <a name="sgml_tag_parser"></a>
        <h4>sgml_tag_parser/</h4>
        <p>The SgmlTagParser is a simple JavaCC/JJTree parser that can recognise
            SGML tags - it has productions for element names, attribute names, attribute values
            and whether the tag marks the opening or closing of an element. It's used
            in the SGML and HTML to XLIFF filters.
        </p>
        
    
        <a name="tagged_markup"></a>
        <h4>tagged_markup/</h4>
        <p>This directory contains abstractions that are used in the XLIFF filters
            for all tagged-markup file types. The SGML, XML, JSP and HTML filters behave
            the same way, so it made sense to build them on a common infrastructure.
            After the input file type has been parsed, the resulting parse tree is
            viewed as a set of TaggedMarkupNodes, rather than SGML, JSP, HTML or XML
            contents.
        </p>
    
        <a name="xml_doc_fragment"></a>
        <h4>xml_doc_fragment/</h4>
        <p>The XmlDocFragmentParser, like the SGML and NonConformant parsers,
            can recognise the lexical tokens in an XML file. This code is used by
            the XML to XLIFF filter.
        </p>
        
        <a name="xml_tag_parser"></a>
        <h4>xml_tag_parser</h4>
        <p>This is the XML version of the <a href="#sgml_tag_parser">SgmlTagParser</a>.
        </p>

        <a name="dtd_doc_fragment"></a>
        <h4>dtd_doc_fragment/</h4>
        <p>This code can recognise DTDs. (<em>need a better description here</em>).
        </p>
        
        
        <!-- Filters directory section -->
        <a name="filters"></a>
        <h3>Filters</h3>
        <p>This directory contains the source code for the various different
            XLIFF filters that are part of this project. In the following
            sections, we'll explore these directories in more detail.
        </p>
        
        
        <a name="format_handling"></a>
        <h4>format_handling/</h4>
        <p>An important part of the filters, this code contains a set of classes
            for converting strings in a source format into XLIFF and TMX equivalents.
            It uses the parsers in the <code>utilities</code> directory to
            recognise the different format types. As well as format-wrapping functions,
            the format_handling directory also contains format extracting functions
            : these can be used in TM systems to determine what percentage of a
            a string is comprised of formatting (helpful when determining how similar
            a source string is to a target string)
        </p>
    
        <a name="book_filter"></a>
        <h4>book_filter/</h4>
        <p>Used in conjunction with the SGML filters, the book filter converts
            Docbook ".book" files to XLIFF. It also contains some code that can walk
            through a directory of sgml files accompanying the .book file
            to determine whether they're translatable or not. (Only sgml files that
            are actually called from the book file need to be translated)
        </p>
        
        <a name="gui/"></a>
        <h4>gui/</h4>
        <p>This contains the swing GUI code for the XLIFF filters. At the
            moment, it also contains a class that acts as a facade for the other
            filters, providing a single point of entry to the functionality of
            the rest of the filters.
            This is code that would be a good candidate for refactoring, or moving
            into another subdirectory in the build tree.
        </p>
    
        <a name="html_parser/"></a>
        <h4>html_parser/</h4>
        <p>This is the source for the HTML to XLIFF filter. It implements
            interfaces found in the <code>tagged_markup</code> directory under
            utilities, and relies on the sgml_filter for much of it's functionality.
        </p>

        <a name="jsp_filter/"></a>
        <h4>jsp_filter/</h4>
        <p>This is the JSP to XLIFF filter. Similar to the HTML filter, it
            implements interfaces from the <code>tagged_markup</code> package
            and relies on the sgml_filter for it's functionality.
        </p>
        
        <a name="non-conformant_sgml_tag_parser/"></a>
        <h4>non-conformant_sgml_tag_parser/</h4>
        <p>The non conformant sgml tag parser is a more relaxed version of the
            sgml tag parser found in the utilities directory. This directory should
            probably be moved under the <code>utilities</code> directory above.
        </p>
        
        <a name="plaintext/"></a>
        <h4>plaintext/</h4>
        <p>This contains the Plaintext to XLIFF filter. Providing the initial
            parsing of plaintext files into blocks of text (paragraphs) and then
            passing each block off to the sentence segmenter, it writes XLIFF
            using the <code>segmenter_formatter</code> code below, and also relies
            on the code found in the <code>general</code> directory found in the 
            <code>utilities</code> directory.
        </p>
        
        <a name="segmenter_formatters/"></a>
        <h4>segmenter_formatters/</h4>
        <p>The segmenter formatters contain a set of interfaces and
            implementations to allow the various filters to write different output.
            For example, we have code that can write plain XLIFF output,
            a "reversed" XLIFF file, containing source, and a dummy translation,
            as well as some debug output, and code to output a mono-lingual TMX file.
            (changing the filters to output XLIFF 1.1 should be just a case of
            changing code here, and updating the <code>format_handling</code> code)
        </p>
        
        <a name="segmenters/"></a>
        <h4>segmenters/</h4>
        <p>At the heart of the documentation XLIFF filters, the segmenters take
            in a block of text, and break them into sentences. We have segmenters
            for a number of languages, but they differ only in the abbreviations
            they recognise. The segmenters are implemented as JavaCC/JJTree
            parsers, which breaks the input text into sentences and formatting.
            The segmenters also act as the underlying wordcounting mechanism for
            the statistics which are output to the XLIFF file : each <code>word()</code>
            production in the parser contributes to the total wordcount.
        </p>
        
        <a name="sgml_filter/"></a>
        <h4>sgml_filter/</h4>
        <p>The sgml filter contains (arguably) the most complex piece of code
            in the XLIFF Filters - this is perhaps not a good thing. It's responsible
            for the SGML, HTML, JSP and XML filters - and attempts to intelligently
            segment <code>tagged-markup</code> parse trees into sentences and produces XLIFF output
            via the <code>segmenter_formatters</code>. The SgmlSegmenterVisitor
            contains most of the functionality, with assistance from the
            SgmlSegmenterVisitorHelper class. This code would be a good candidate
            for refactoring (or re-implementation)
        </p>
        
        
        <a name="software_filters/"></a>
        <h4>software_filters/</h4>
        <p>The software filters contain JavaCC/JJTree parsers for all of the
            supported software message filetypes. They also contain code that performs
            conversion to XLIFF for these filetypes and a simple TMX producing class,
            which can take a software message file and it's translated equivalent and output
            a TMX file. Finally, it contains a useful pretty-printer for software
            message files, which is used to output a cleanly formatted version of
            any software message file.
        </p>
        
        <a name="staroffice_filter/"></a>
        <h4>staroffice_filter/</h4>
        <p>The StarOffice/OpenOffice.org filter converts sxw, sxc and sxi files
            to XLIFF. While it uses the XML filter to provide it's main functionality,
            it contains code to extract the <code>content.xml</code> file from the
            document zip archive, segments it, converts to XLIFF and then bundles
            the rest of the files which make up the document into the xlz archive.
        </p>       
        
        <a name="xliff_validator/"></a>
        <h4>xliff_validator/</h4>
        <p>This contains some <em>very</em> simple code which just passes an
            XLIFF file through a validating XML parser to make sure the contents
            are both well-formed and conform to the XLIFF dtd. This is useful
            during debugging.
        </p>
        
        <a name="xml_config_parser/"></a>
        <h4>xml_config_parser/</h4>
        <p>The XML Configuration Manager manages the configuration files used
            by the XML filter. Files added to the manager are saved in a
            flat-file repository, and indexed so that they can be selected at
            runtime when an XML file is presented for conversion to XLIFF. Each
            XML Filter configuration file lists which tags in the input XML document
            are translatable, which are inline, which should have their contents
            protected from segmentation, etc. The configuration file is in XML
            format, and a DTD for this format is included.
        </p>
        
        <a name="xml_filter/"></a>
        <h4>xml_filter/</h4>
        <p>The XML filter relies on the SGML filter to provide much of it's
            functionality and also uses the XML Configuration Manager to select
            the correct filter configuration file (done by searching for either the
            namespace of the input XML document or the DOCTYPE declaration if one
            was declared : each config file must specify one of these). The
            configuration file manager then creates an object which implements the tagged_markup 
            interfaces (SegmenterTable and TagTable) which can then be used by
            the <code>sgml_filter</code> code.
        </p>
       
        <a name="backconverters"></a>
        <h3>Backconverters</h3>
        <p>This directory contains two components. The first is a generic backconverter
            to walk down <code>skeleton.skl</code> files, outputting each formatting
            element. As it does this, it also references the <code>content.xlf</code>
            file, inserting translations whenever it encounters a placeholder for
            trans-unit elements from the content.xlf. To do this, it assumes that
            the input is an <code>XLZ</code> archive - that is a zip file 
            containing both content and skeleton files. It's conceivable that we
            could also write additional code here that converts an XLIFF file into other
            file formats, such as PO files, or other software message containers,
            however in essence, it's function is to convert an XLIFF file
            back to it's original source format. The generic backconverter also contains
            some format-specific classes which further process the backconverter.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second component is an XLIFF to TMX converter, based around XSLT,
            this takes a fully translated XLIFF file, and converts it to TMX for
            future use with a translation memory application.
        </p>

            it at least should provide some guidance to developers looking at the
            code for the first time. If you have any thoughts or comments on this
