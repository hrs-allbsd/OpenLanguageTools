        <h1>Open Language Tools XLIFF Filters Roadmap</h1>
  
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>This document lists the areas for development that we should on for the
            next release of the XLIFF Filters. It's not exhaustive, and since 
            it's been drawn up before many people on the project have seen any 
            code, it's liable to change when we release. However, in case people
            want to think about where they'd like to work on the filters, here
            are few places I think the code needs work. We should try to address
            these areas for the 1.1 release, but there's no date for that at the
            moment, as we don't know how many people are going to be hacking on
            this code.
        </p>    
        <p> As soon as we've got volunteers for these items, I'll put owners on
            the list below. Of course, we're <em>absolutely not</em> constraining new
            development on any of these items - there's loads of other areas where
            <a href="https://open-language-tools.dev.java.net/#help">we need
            help !</a> Go for it !

        <h3>XLIFF 1.1 Support</h3>
        <p> The XLIFF filters that we have at the moment are all based around the
            XLIFF 1.0 specification. We'd like to upgrade the filters so that they produce
            XLIFF 1.1 files instead. This shouldn't be too much work : there's one main
            class that we use to write XLIFF (the <code>XliffSegmenterFormatter</code>)
            for all the filters, and some additional classes which are implementations
            of the <code>FormatWrapper</code> interface, are used to wrap formatting
            codes in XLIFF, such as html tags, printf formatting codes, etc.        
        </p>
        
        
        <a name="opendoc"></a>
        <h3>Support for OASIS Open Document format, including multiple &lt;file&gt; elements</h3>
        <p> On our first release, the XLIFF filters didn't support the <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=office">
            OASIS Open Document format</a> and we think they should. There is already
            some support for the older OpenOffice.org file format, which works fine
            for simple documents. The initial work in getting the Open Document format
            should be quite simple. However, the OpenOffice.org filters only support
            single-object-documents : that is, a single Writer, Impress, Draw or Calc document
            can be converted to XLIFF correctly, but we don't yet support embedded
            objects (eg. a Calc spreadsheet embedded in a Writer document). This
            would require some work on the SegmenterFormatter interface, and it's
            implementations.
        </p>
        
        <a name="compliance"></a>
        <h3>Compliance</h3>
        <p>When writing the existing filters, XLIFF-representation documents, like
            the HTML or <a href="http://xliff-tools.freedesktop.org/wiki/Projects/XliffPoGuide">PO</a>
            guides didn't exist : we should try to adhere to the guidelines
            put down in these documents for the filters that apply (though given
            the content/skeleton structure we use, that may be difficult : ideally
            we should continue to use a single component for writing XLIFF files)
        
        </p>
        
        <a name="i18n"></a>
        <h3>Internationalisation</h3>
        <p><strong>Completed Already !</strong></strong></p>
        <p>This probably isn't so complex for the filters : they're all written 
            so that they can handle input files in any encoding (user-specified) and 
            always write UTF-8 XLIFF. However, there are some user-visible messages
            in the GUI portion of the XLIFF filters. It would be good to get this
            small interface correctly internationalised.
        </p>

        <h3>Improve the segmenter</h3>
        <p>This roadmap item may be a bit of a stretch, but I'll put it in, because
            it's a small defficiency of the tools at the moment. All of the document-focused
            filters (not software-message formats) use a single segmenter, which is
            responsible for breaking the input into sentences. This segmenter is good,
            but not perfect. Particularly, it has problems dealing with abbreviations
            at the end of sentences. It would be good to improve the segmenter so
            that it's more robust.
        </p>
        
        <a name="SRX"></a>
        <h3>Implement SRX support in the segmenter </h3>
        <p>Related to the previous item, and possibly superceding it, depending on
        resources, we would like to implement a segmenter that includes support
        the <a href="http://www.lisa.org/oscar/seg/">SRX file format</a>. SRX
        stands for Segmentation Rules Exchange, and is an XML-based file format
        that would allow users to tune the behaviour of the segmenter. This would
        potentially make the segmenter easier to extend/alter by end users - which
        would be quite useful. We'd also have to be careful here, since as soon as
        people start using different segmentation behaviours, a possible outcome
        is that their translation memories become incompatible. If we implement
        this, we should also recommend a standard segmentation rule set.
