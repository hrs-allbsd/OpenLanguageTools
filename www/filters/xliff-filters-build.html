        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>This document aims to tell folks what they need to do to build the
            Open Language Tools XLIFF Filters. It covers the build requirements
            and includes the output of a
            successful build so developers won't be put off by seeing occasional
            warning message produced during the build.
        </p>
        
        <p>As well as being interested in building the filters, readers may also
            be interested in reading the document <a href="about-xliff-filters.html" title="About the
            Open Language Tools XLIFF Filters">About the Open Language Tools XLIFF
            Filters</a>, which provides a good introduction to the XLIFF filters,
            along with the document <a href="xliff-filters-code.html">About the 
            Open Language Tools XLIFF Filters source code</a> which has more 
            details about the source code that is in CVS.
        </p>
        
        <a name="build_reqs"></a>
        <h3>Build requirements</h3>
        <p>
            The Open Language Tools XLIFF Filters don't have many build requirements.
            In order to build the filters, you need at least  the Java 2 
            Standard Edition version 1.4.2 SDK. This can be downloaded
            <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html">here</a>. The build
            also works using the Java 5 SDK - we haven't tested with other
            Java implementations : if you do build with other Java implementations
            please let us know, and we'll update this document.
        </p>
        <p>
            We use 
            <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a> to manage our build 
            system, and require at least release version 1.6.2 - this and later versions
            of Ant can be downloaded <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Other third party libraries
            and applications which are required during the build are bundled as part
            of the workspace and don't need to be downloaded separately. You can 
            view these libraries, and the licences terms governing their use in the
            <code>utilities/jars</code> directory.
        </p>
        
        <p>The source code can be checked out of the workspace by following the
            <a href="https://open-language-tools.dev.java.net/source/browse/open-language-tools/">
            CVS setup guidelines</a> - we strongly recommend developers use ssh
            to secure their CVS communication with our repository : more 
            information on this can be found in the document 
            <a href="https://www.dev.java.net/scdocs/ddSSHGuide">
            Tunneling with SSH</a>
        </p>
        
        <a name="build_output"></a>
        <h3>Build command and output</h3>
        
        <p> To build the Open Language Tools XLIFF Filters, simply issue the
        command :</p>
        
        <p>
            <pre>% ant filters</pre>
        </p>
        
        <p>The built binaries will be dropped in the newly created
           <code>./build</code> directory at the top level of the workspace.
        </p>
        
        <p>Note that some of the sentence segmenters can cause the Java compiler's
        virtual machine to exceed the boundary of it's stack - if you encounter
        an error message :</p>
        
        <p><pre>
            The system is out of resources.
            Consult the following stack trace for details.
            java.lang.StackOverflowError
        </pre></p>
        
        <p>
            then you should set an environment variable <code>ANT_OPTS</code> to the
            value <code>-Xss8192000</code> before running the ant command. Depending
            on which operating system or command shell you use, the way to set
            this variable will vary. On UNIX, running ksh, this setting is :
        </p>
        <p>       
            <pre>
% ANT_OPTS=-Xss8192000
% export ANT_OPTS
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>This problem has been fixed in later versions of the Java SDK, so
        setting this environment variable may not be required for all users.
        <p>
        
        <p>Here is the output of a complete build of the Open Language Tools
            XLIFF Filters :
