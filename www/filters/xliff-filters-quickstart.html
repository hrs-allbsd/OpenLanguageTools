  <h1>Open Language Tools XLIFF Filters Quickstart &amp; User's
  Guide</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>This document serves as a quickstart guide and user manual for
  the Open Language Tools XLIFF Filters. The filters are very
  simple to use - just drag &amp; drop, so this will be a short
  document.</p>

  <h2>Installation</h2>

  <p>To install the XLIFF Filters, first download the latest
  release of Java. The filters require at least release 1.4.2
  <small><a href="#note">(see note)</a></small>. These can be
  obtained at <a href="http://java.com">http://java.com</a> -
  follow the link on the main page to obtain Java for your
  platform.</p>

  <p>Next you should download the appropriate binary of the filters
  which is available on <a href=
  "http://java.net/projects/open-language-tools/downloads/directory/releases">
  the Releases section of our web site</a>, (or you could even
  <a href="xliff-filters-build.html">build them yourself</a>!).</p>

  <p>We have two possible builds available - the contents are the
  same for each platform, but the installation actions are slightly
  different to account for platform differences.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Windows : xliff_filters_v1_0_win.zip</li>

    <li>UNIX (including MacOSX) :
    xliff_filters_v1_0_unix.tar.gz</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Download the file for your platform and extract it from it's
  archive. Having done that, then either double-click the
  <code>.jar</code> file or issue the command <code>java -jar
  xliff_filters_v1_0_unix.jar</code> or <code>java -jar
  xliff_filters_v1_0_win.jar</code> which will then launch the
  installer program.</p>

  <p>The installer program will ask you to accept a license and
  then ask you to enter a location to install the software.</p>

  <h2>Running the XLIFF Filters</h2>

  <p>Launch the filters either by double-clicking the desktop
  launcher, going to the <em>"Start"</em> menu in windows and
  selecting the launcher for the filters, or by running the
  <code>filters.sh</code> or <code>filters.bat</code> scripts from
  the command line. You should see the following application appear
  :</p>

  "XLIFF Filters Screenshot" /></p>

  <p>To operate the filters, drag &amp; drop a source file on the
  application, and the file will be converted to a <code>xlz
  file</code> in the same directory as the source file. When the
  conversion is completed, a dialog box will be shown. If you drop
  multiple files on the application, they will all be converted to
  XLIFF sequentially.</p>

  <p>For more detailed log messages produced during the conversion
  process, click the "Show log" button.</p>

  <h2>Configuring the XLIFF Filters</h2>

  <p>The filters don't have a user-friendly configuration mechanism
  yet. Right now, the preferences are stored as values written
  using the java.util.prefs API. These preferences can be changed
  directly by users and include ways to change the source language
  for input files, the source-file encoding, and the directory
  containing the XML configuration files. (on UNIX-like platforms,
  these are stored in
  <code>~/.java/.userPrefs/org/jvnet/olt/filters/gui/prefs.xml</code>
  on windows, they're stored somewhere in the registry).</p>

  <p>For the XML to XLIFF filter, the XML configuration file
  database it uses is rebuilt by the application automatically on
  startup when finding that the <code>configured.xml.config</code>
  preference is set to <code>false</code>. It rebuilds the config
  store (saved in a private location) by parsing the files in the
  <code>xml-config</code> directory.</p>

  <p>If you have any changes or questions that we should add this
  guide, please get in touch with us. Likewise, if you encounter
  any problems running the filters, please send mail to one our our
  mailing lists.</p><br />

  <p><a name="note" id="note"></a> <small>The Open Language Tools
  XLIFF Filters have been written and tested with the Sun
  implementation of Java 2 Standard Edition 1.4.2 and they are
  known to work with the Sun Java 5 implementation. Other Java
  implementation may also work, but we haven't tested them. If you
  run the filters on different Java implementations, let us know
  and we'll update this page !</small></p>
