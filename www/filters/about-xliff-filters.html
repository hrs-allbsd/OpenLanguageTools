        <h3>Introduction</h3>
  
        <p>This short article is being written to serve as a short introduction to the
        XLIFF Filters, released as part of the Open Language Tools. It's not going to
        get too technical, so everybody should be able to find it useful !
  
        <h3>Why XLIFF Filters ?</h3>
  
        <p>XLIFF is a standard file format that aims to hide the complexity of source
        file formats from translators and tools providers, and allow information about
        the various steps that are often done in localisation processes be carried
        along with the file being translated.</p>
  
        <p>For example, rather than needing to maintain a separate log file with information 
        about the wordcount of a file, or notes from translators, or information about the
        original context of the source file, in XLIFF, all of this information is carried
        inside the file itself. This has a number of advantages, but in particular, it
        means that people processing these files are always going to have the most up
        to date information about the file, whatever stage it's at in the localisation
        process.</p>
  
        <p>Another advantage is, that once we have a standard file format, translation
        tools can be written that only need to process XLIFF files - as soon as your
        source file has been converted to XLIFF, other tools further down the localisation
        process-chain do not need to be aware of any details about the source file format.</p>
  
        <p>The problem is, that so far, there aren't many freely available XLIFF filters
        around, so translators have not had the choice of using many different translation tools.</p>
  
        <p>The <strong>Open Language Tools</strong> project aims to provide a set of XLIFF 
        filters for a number of common source file formats, so that others can work on
        translation tools to further enhance translator productivity which work with XLIFF
        files.</p>
  
        <h3>What is an XLIFF filter ?</h3>
 
        <p>There are a few things that an XLIFF filter does :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Parsing input file</li>
            <li>Breaking file into "blocks"</li>
            <li>Sentence-segmenting each "block"</li>
            <li>Writing XLIFF file</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Here's a quick diagram which shows you these steps :</p>

        </p>
        
        <p>I'll explain each of these steps one by one in the following sections.</p>
